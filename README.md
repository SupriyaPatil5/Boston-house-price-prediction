# Boston-house-price-prediction

This project has been carried out in collaboration with Neelima Saini and Umesh Salunke.

The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston. 

The following describes the dataset columns: 

CRIM - per capita crime rate by town

ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM - average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,00

PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town

B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town

LSTAT - % lower status of the population

MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

We as a team did data analysis , data cleaning, feature engineering , created visulizations and created ML models like - Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic net, Polynomial regression model to find the model with the highest accuracy and measured the accuracy through different paramters as MSE,RMSE etc.

The data set for the same is uploaded as BOSTON.csv

The Notebook for code is .ipnb file
